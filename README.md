# TokenKid Contract

TokenKid is simple an NFT Marketplace built on [Celo](https://celo.org)

> _This project hasn't been reviewed\Audited by other engineers. I might have missed some errors._ ðŸ˜€

Built on [Truffle](https://trufflesuite.com/docs) and [Ganache](https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache)

Deployed via [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/)



## TO DO Improvements before deploy to mainnet
1. Line by line review of the contract
2. Security Audit
3. Write tests
4. Abstract `enum ERC20TokenSymbol` from `TokenKidFactory` contract
5. make `TokenKidFactory` an upgradable smart contract.
    * This will separate logic and data. ERC20 contract addresses are hard coded in `getERC20TokenSymbolByValue`, Incase one of the addresses changed we would have to deploy a new contract.
